# Road Track

Road Track is a Next.js tourism platform MVP for the Udupi region. It connects tourists with verified destinations, resorts, tourist vehicles, tour packages, WhatsApp enquiries, emergency support, and partner dashboards.

## Built Features

- Premium customer homepage inspired by the provided full-bleed travel template.
- Destination pages for Udupi, Malpe Beach, Kapu Beach, and Agumbe.
- Dynamic quote planner with people, days, vehicle, resort category, and guide option.
- WhatsApp pre-filled enquiry messages.
- Enquiry API route with validation.
- Super Admin dashboard for leads, approvals, commission, partner inventory, and broadcasts.
- Resort owner dashboard for rooms, prices, sold-out status, amenities, media, and enquiries.
- Vehicle owner dashboard for availability, driver details, rates, package routes, photos, and enquiries.
- Email OTP login UI with expiry, resend delay, attempt warning, edit email, and first-time profile setup.
- Privacy page and PostgreSQL-ready Prisma schema.

## Recommended Database

Use PostgreSQL for the core database.

For this business, the data is relational: users, partners, destinations, resorts, vehicles, leads, assignments, commissions, reviews, media, and OTP records all need reliable relationships and reporting. PostgreSQL handles this cleanly and can scale from MVP to a larger marketplace.

Recommended launch setup:

1. Supabase Postgres for MVP and early production.
2. Prisma ORM for migrations and type-safe database access.
3. Supabase Storage or S3-compatible storage for resort and vehicle media.
4. Google SMTP first for OTP email, then move to Resend, SendGrid, or Amazon SES when volume grows.

Neon Postgres is also a strong option if you want a serverless Postgres database with branching-first development. Supabase is more complete for this product because it can cover database, auth, storage, realtime, and dashboard operations in one platform.

## Routes

- `/` - Customer marketplace and trip planner
- `/destinations/udupi`
- `/destinations/malpe-beach`
- `/destinations/kapu-beach`
- `/destinations/agumbe`

## Local Development

```bash
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Production Wiring Checklist

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
- Create a PostgreSQL database and set `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL`.
- Install Prisma when persistence is ready:

```bash
npm.cmd install @prisma/client
npm.cmd install -D prisma dotenv
npx.cmd prisma migrate dev --name init
```

- Replace the mock seed data in `src/lib/data.ts` with database queries.
- Store submitted enquiries from `/api/enquiries` in the `Lead` table.
- Hash OTPs before saving them in `OtpToken`.
- Add rate limiting for OTP and enquiry endpoints.
- Move media uploads to Supabase Storage or S3.
- Use HTTPS in production through hosting or Cloudflare.

## Notes

The current MVP is safe to run as a polished demo and client presentation. Before accepting real bookings, connect the database, SMTP, rate limiting, and payment or commission settlement workflow.
